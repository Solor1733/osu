Done:
-Reading Ratio (RR)
  -RR is set to 1 when HDFL enabled
  -A flexible formula for calculating RR when given a reading difficulty value (double)
-Optimal BPM
  -Gives a easiest to read BPM for the map, any changes to SV will only make the map harder
  -Not perfect but as close as I could get
-Define a gap between the easiest state and HDFL
  -It gives normal SR and PP now.
  -Everything related to this should be somewhat clean now...
-Multiply SR by some amount based on RR
  -When RR is 0, it's 7 star, when RR is 1, it's mid-8-star
  -Use linear function for now

Needs Fixing:
  MOVE DELTATIME OUTSIDE IT RUNS SO SLOW

Not Done:
-A calculator for reading difficulty
  -This value is not like strain, the result it gives will be converted to RR
  -The less it has to do with SR, the better
  -It should include mods
